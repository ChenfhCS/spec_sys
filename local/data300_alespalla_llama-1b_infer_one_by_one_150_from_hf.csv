You can try setting a timer on your phone or a digital kitchen timer. That way, you'll be reminded when it's time to check on your food or turn it off. Additionally, you might consider wearing a smartwatch or keeping a small kitchen clock nearby to stay aware of the time. If you're often distracted, you could also cook something that requires minimal supervision, like oatmeal or scrambled eggs. If none of these solutions work, you could try enlisting the help of a family member or roommate to remind you. If you're really struggling to stay on top of cooking, you might want to consider meal prep or cooking in batches so that you can focus on other tasks while your food cooks. There are also apps and devices designed to help people stay organized and on track in the kitchen. Experiment with a few of these options to see what works best for you. You might also consider making a list or calendar to schedule when you're cooking, so you can plan ahead and avoid forgetting","there's a lot of ways you can make cooking more reliable and consistent.  many people use a timer when they're making food so they don't have to keep checking to see if it's done.
